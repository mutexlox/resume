\section{Experience}
  \textbf{Google: Software Engineer}, Google Cloud Security \hfill July 2015 --
  \begin{minipage}{0.84\textwidth}
    \vspace{0.2em}
    \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
        \item Worked on Trusted Platform Module code and related software:
          \vspace{-0.5em}
          \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
            \item Found bugs in Linux kernel's TPM 2.0 driver; wrote and
              merged fixes to upstream
            \item Wrote code to generate Endorsement Key certificates
            \item Implemented TPM register interface to public specification
            \item Dramatically increased test coverage and added automated fuzzing
          \end{itemize}
        \item Substantially increased difficulty for an attacker that manages
          to break out of a virtual machine to move laterally to other
          production machines.
        \item Evaluated several options for detecting the Spectre and Meltdown
          vulnerabilities using Intel hardware performance counters:
          \vspace{-0.5em}
          \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
            \item Reviewed research on side-channel cache attack detection
            \item Proposed detection methods
            \item Measured false positive/negative rates for proposed schemes
            \item Wrote a widely-read internal report on detection options
          \end{itemize}
        \item Designed, implemented, and evaluated several hardware
          performance counter options to attempt to detect specific
          malicious behavior on Google Compute Engine.
        \item Worked on implementation and test infrastructure for a
          minimal Type-I hypervisor. Automated test process and reduced time
          to run tests from roughly 30 minutes to roughly 5.
        \item Developed a plan to improve inclusiveness in the Cloud Security
          organization as it grows, shared it with the directors of the org,
          and met with one of them to discuss it in depth and further develop
          it.
    \end{itemize}
