\section{Experience}
  \textbf{Google, Site Reliability Engineering Intern}
    \hfill Summer 2013
  \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
    \item Increased configurability of a program that garbage collects old files,\\
          improving reliability of systems that serve those files.
    \item Improved accessibility and ease of use of a command-line tool that is\\
          used to analyze testing and monitoring files.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Khan Academy, Software Engineering Intern} \hfill Summer 2012
  \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
  \item Simplified A/B testing for changes in key metrics. My changes have \\
    been used in nearly all A/B tests at Khan Academy since my internship.
  \item Worked on a video recommendations system by writing a program \\
    that emits correlations for pairs of videos and implementing a database \\
    model in Google App Engine's datastore.
  \item Wrote a script to monitor Google Code and GitHub for unusually\\
    high rates of bug reports. The script has caught at least one major bug\\
    before any developers noticed it.  (\href{https://github.com/Khan/beep-boop}
                                            {https://github.com/Khan/beep-boop})

  \textbf{Instructor, 15-131: Great Practical Ideas for Computer Scientists}
    \hfill Fall 2013
  \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
    \item Ran a course that teaches students important topics including\\
      UNIX usage, debugging, and regular expressions.
    \item Wrote many new programs to test student knowledge of course material.
    \item Organized TAs to create even more programs to test student knowledge.
    \item Updated handouts about the material and turned them into web pages.
  \end{itemize}

  % Blank line below is to get spacing on "Spring 2013" correct -- otherwise
  % the hphantom doesn't change the placement and it's too far left.
