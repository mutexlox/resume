  \experience{2022}{}{Google: Senior Software Engineer}{ChromeOS}{
    \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
        \item Tech Lead for ChromeOS Experimentation
        \item Leading implementation for long-term, multi-engineer early-boot
          A/B experimentation:
          \vspace{-0.5em}
          \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
              \item Collaborating with PM on client outreach, ensuring
                design meets their needs
              \item Mentoring new hire junior engineer, delegating appropriate
                work to them
              \item Implementing complex, safety-critical pieces, e.g.
                disaster recovery
              \item Anticipated to unblock 5+ teams, allowing safer, more
                data-driven decisions org-wide
          \end{itemize}
        \item Code review 5-10 A/B test configuration changes per week, plus 5-10
          code changes
        \item Recognized as go-to person for experimentation and one of two
          go-to people for crash reporting
    \end{itemize}}

  \experience{2018}{2022}{Google: Software Engineer}{ChromeOS}{
    \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
        \item Designed, planned, and assigned work for early-boot A/B
          experimentation, prioritizing safety and disaster recovery
       \item Designed and implemented late-boot platform A/B experimentation,
         working with client teams to ensure their needs were met. Now used by
         around a dozen experiments
        \item Designed and implemented system to upload crashes that occur
          during integration testing
        \item Implemented integration tests for crash reporting, detecting many
          bugs
        \item Implemented alerts to notify teams when their code has high-rate
          crashes
        \item Improved reliability of crash reporter by adding metrics, fixing
          bugs, and reducing server load
        \item Ported interrupt-handling devices from kernel to userspace
          (in Rust)
    \end{itemize}

  \experience{2015}{2018}{Google: Software Engineer}{Cloud Security}{
    \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
        \item Met key enterprise needs as one of two engineers on virtual
          Trusted Platform Module:
          \vspace{-0.5em}
          \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
            \item Found bugs in Linux TPM driver; wrote and upstreamed fixes
            \item Implemented TPM register interface to public specification
          \end{itemize}
        \item Increased difficulty for attackers that escape a VM to move
          laterally to other machines
        \item Evaluated several options for detecting Spectre and Meltdown,
          reviewed various options' false positive and negative rates, and
          produced a report on detection options.
        \item Designed, implemented, and evaluated methods of using x86
          performance counters to detect specific malicious behavior pattern
        \item Automated testing for a Type-I hypervisor, reducing time to test
          from 30 minutes to 5
        \item Developed plan to improve inclusiveness in the Cloud Security
          organization, shared with the directors, and met with one director to
          discuss in depth and further develop it
